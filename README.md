# ACM Research Coding Challenge (Spring 2021)


Hi! This is the circular genome map for the Tomato Curly Stunt Virus I came up with!

At first, I had no idea on how to do this so I found a website that explained biopython: https://biopython.org/wiki/SeqIO. This is where I learned about what you can do with a genobank file and the library bio. Then I used this website: https://biopython-cn.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/en/chr17.html for instructions on how to convert a genobank file into a circular diagram. That is where I found the code to solve this challenge.
